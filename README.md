# Soil Fertility Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

The **Soil Fertility Prediction using Machine Learning** project aims to develop a data-driven model for accurately estimating soil fertility levels in order to optimize agricultural practices. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and utilizing a comprehensive dataset of soil attributes, our project provides a reliable and cost-effective solution for farmers and agricultural experts.

## Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** We initiated the project by performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) based on descriptive statistics and graphical analysis to understand the properties of the data.

- **Hypothesis Testing:** To differentiate between fertile and non-fertile soil, we conducted Hotelling’s T-square test and student’s t-test, leading to the conclusion that there is a significant difference between the two groups.

## Classification Models

We applied various classification models to predict soil fertility, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naïve Bayesian

### Model Performance

Here are the accuracy measures of these models:

| Method                | Accuracy  | Sensitivity | Specificity |
|-----------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Logistic Regression   | 0.8333    | 0.9091      | 0.7692      |
| Decision Tree         | 0.75      | 0.5454      | 0.9231      |
| K-NN                  | 0.7083    | 0.6363      | 0.7692      |
| Support Vector Machine| 0.7916    | 0.8181      | 0.7692      |
| Naïve Bayesian        | 0.875     | 0.9090      | 0.8462      |
| Random Forest         | 0.9583    | 0.9091      | 0.9230      |

## Conclusion

After comprehensive analysis, the **Random Forest** model emerged as the most effective and accurate method for predicting soil fertility, outperforming other models.

## Structural Equation Models

We constructed different structural equation models to study the direct and indirect impact of variables on soil fertility. The selected model revealed that soil parameters such as sand, silt, and clay play a crucial role in soil fertility prediction.

## Importance of the Project

Understanding and predicting soil fertility is essential for optimizing crop yield, resource allocation, and sustainable agricultural practices, addressing food security challenges, and promoting efficient land management in the face of changing environmental conditions.

By applying a diverse range of classification techniques in machine learning and employing structural equation modeling, this project has the potential to revolutionize agricultural practices and provide valuable insights into soil fertility dynamics, paving the way for data-driven decision-making in sustainable farming.
